## MCPs

- Use `context7` for code generation and library documentation

## Global rules

- Only create an abstraction if it's actually needed
- Prefer clear function/variable names over inline comments
- Avoid helper functions when a simple inline expression would suffice
- The 'gh' CLI is installed, use it - Don't use emojis
- Left align the happy path. Early returns over nesting
- Prefer small, well-scoped files
- Be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision
